                <h2>BIG Research 4 - Shopping Carts</h2>
                
                <p>Shopping carts are an important decision for a company, and come with a wide variety of features, styles, and designs. These software apps enable online transactions and can help customers utilize deals, gift cards, and other specials when making a purchase. Customers add the items they wish to buy to their shopping cart, and then, on the checkout page, the software calculates the price of the products, then adds shipping and handling charges as well as taxes. (<a href="https://financesonline.com/comparison-15-leading-shopping-cart-software-systems/">Andre</a>)</p>
                
                <p>It’s an integral part of any retail sales site, and can be the difference between a consumer completing a purchase or abandoning their cart. In fact, shoppers will abandon their cart 68% percent of time (<a href="https://www.nchannel.com/blog/ecommerce-stats-trends-online-shopping/">Hufford</a>). Reasons why vary and include surprise costs, high shipping rates, and having to create an account in order to purchase; the last thing any website wants is users abandoning the shopping process because the purchasing layout is unattractive or the cart or difficult to use.</p>
                
                <p>The performance of any website's shopping cart must be seamless, fitting well with the online catalog, customer service desk, and the payment processing gateway. Of course, shopping carts come in a plethora of choices, so prioritizing which features are most important to your online retail operation is crucial when making the decision of which one to choose.</p>

                <p>It’s difficult to choose a cart strictly on price. Some lower priced options impose restrictions on transaction or bandwidth, while others limit what kind of features are available. Some may charge fees for transactions and for add-ons that let you integrate with other third-party tools, such as offering payments through PayPal. Some carts will have tiers based on how much bandwidth you need. Database storage is also often based on price, with lower prices meaning less storage space. When choosing a cart, it’s good to have a firm idea of what your business may need and to try and choose one that won’t have you going over your bandwidth or storage space. Otherwise, that monthly bill with overage fees is going to be a nasty surprise. (<a href="http://www.pcmag.com/picks/the-best-e-commerce-software">Martinez</a>)</p>

                <p>You should also find a cart that doesn’t ask you to rely solely on documentation, tutorials, and forums for customer support. While those are great resources, keep in mind that trouble can strike any time of the day or night, and you don’t want to be relegated to trying to troubleshoot it alone. The best programs will have responsive customer support available any hour of the day.</p>

                <p>Finally, remember that security is an incredibly important consideration. While some of your customers may be internet savvy enough to use a virtual private network (VPN) service, most won’t, and many may not even know what it is. Your customers are counting on you to keep their data safe. To protect them, make sure your online store and its underlying web hosting provider either offer you a Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) certificate or will accommodate a third-party certificate. Then make sure to invest in a solid website monitoring tool so you stay on top of any performance or potential security problem with your webstore in real time. Take care of your customers and they’ll help take care of your business.</p>
                
                <p>While this might seem like an intimidating list of items, shopping for a Shopping Cart program is like shopping for any other piece of software. The best way to do it is have a laundry list of items your website needs, then do some solid research or consult a professional for ideas. Also be sure to read reviews and check the fine print on how costs are bundled. Following a few common sense rules should net you the best cart for your business.</p>
