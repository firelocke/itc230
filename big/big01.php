                <h2>BIG Research #1: Responsive vs Mobile</h2>
                
                <p>In 2016, almost 63% of the world owned a mobile phone, and that number is expected to increase exponentially thanks to growing sales in India and China (<a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/274774/forecast-of-mobile-phone-users-worldwide/">Statista Research Department</a>). Having a presence on mobile is more important than ever, but many businesses are failing to invest in money to update their websites properly to be mobile friendly, while others are going through needless expense to create user apps.</p>
                
                <p>How should a designer help their clients navigate this new market?</p>

                <p>First, realize that asking whether it’s better to use a responsive website or a mobile app is the wrong question. Because each business is so different and the two platforms so diverse, there’s not a clear answer. Instead, having your clients consider the benefits and drawbacks of each platform will answer the question more clearly.</p>

                <p>The first thing to realize is that, despite the growing app market, for many users websites are still their go-to resource for many online activities. For instance, when users look for online information they don’t generally browse an app store; they look to the net (<a href="https://thinkmobiles.com/blog/responsive-website-vs-mobile-app/">Korol</a>). Many people still prefer to make purchases, large purchases especially, on a laptop or desktop system (<a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20140630006098/en/IDG-Global-Mobile-Survey-Puts-Spotlight-Mobile">Businesswire</a>). In fact, in a study of senior business executives, 93% of them went on to purchase that product via the Internet using a laptop or desktop (<a href="https://www.bluecorona.com/blog/mobile-marketing-statistics/">Blue Corona</a>).</p>

                <p>Even if your clients were to build an app first, they may find they need a website, if only for brand recognition; a way for customers to find and read about their app and services. However, sometimes a website and an app can complement each other. A good example is Instagram, which was a mobile-first product that later added web functionality, but whose main functions are still found only through the app (<a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/235981">Varshneya</a>).</p>

                <p>Mobile websites are available for all users, and don’t require download or installation, and they’ll work regardless of operating system. It’s also far easier--and cheaper--to update, support, and roll out bug fixes for a website. It’s also less expensive, as your client will not have to create native apps for the different types of mobile phones, tablets, or even desktop systems.</p>

                <p>Some of the drawbacks, especially on mobile devices, may be slower loading times, which might cause a customer to quit the site in impatience. Websites also need an internet connection in order to load, and users may be reluctant to use bandwidth if on a limited data program or while roaming. And websites may be limited in what they can do, especially on a mobile platform, no matter how cleverly they’re designed.</p>

                <p>Mobile apps have the advantage of not dealing with these issues. They can work so long as the device can be turned on, so internet connectivity is not an issue. Even when online, apps tend to load faster and use less data overall. They can also integrate seamlessly into useful phone functions such as microphone, camera, and GPS, allowing for a fast, seamless experience in areas where a mobile browser may have trouble.</p>

                <p>They can also give a unique user experience, allowing more streamlined interactivity and perhaps even special or brand new features or functions. One example of this is <a href="https://simonscat.com/">Simon’s Cat</a>, a website of humorous cat cartoons that released a game app based on the cats in the cartoons. You can’t play the game online or watch the videos through the app, and yet the two platforms compliment one another, each drawing in new fans in their own way.</p>

                <p>Part of the drawbacks of apps, however, are the very popularity of the apps themselves. There are hundreds, if not thousands of apps that exist for almost every purpose one can think of. Many have become old and well established standards. A new or unknown app has an uphill battle getting noticed, especially against apps that are already liked and trusted.</p>

                <p>Another issue may be the app platforms themselves. Apps are heavily controlled by the dominant app stores owners, Apple and Google. These companies control what apps are allowed to exist, how apps are built, what apps get promoted, and charge a 30% tax on revenues, which is an expense that will ultimately come out of your client’s pocket. Both companies also censor. For instance, Apple bans Bitcoin and porn from its store, while Google kills any app that it believes harms users (<a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/mobile-web-vs-app-usage-statistics-2014-4?op=1">Edwards</a>). And trying to sell apps outside those platforms can be difficult, and require an advertising budget that may be equal to or above the tax these companies demand.</p>

                <p>When helping your client decide between these paths, encourage them to consider what would make their customers’ lives as comfortable as possible. Ask them who will use the product, and how often. Websites tend to work best with new or occasional clients, while a mobile app works best with regular clients, especially when the user needs to complete a goal, such as checking a bank balance. For budget concerns, web development tends to be the better option, while mobile apps are better when your client requires high performance. With careful consideration, you and your client will come to a workable solution that can best benefit their business.</p>
