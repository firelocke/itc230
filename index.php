                <p>Hi, my name's Kat! I'm currently a student at Seattle Central College, learning the arcane art of Web Design. It's a fascinating process that apparently requires voodoo dolls. Oh, not for the design itself, but for recalitrant computers; it's less expensive then throwing them out a window.</p>

                <p>When not learning the arcane tongue of long-dead geeks (that would be coding for you luddites), I tend to be reading, writing, walking, or playing video games. Writing is my special passion, and I've been doing it since I was eight. I've also run two writing groups and one Discord server, as well as conquoring <a href ="https://nanowrimo.org/about-nano">NaNoWriMo</a> year after year. And when doing none of those, I tend to be binge-watching bad TV while pinned down by two of the most neurotic cats that ever begged for food.</p>
